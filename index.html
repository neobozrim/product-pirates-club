            During the workshop you are going to build a few prototypes using different ML/AI tools. Part of your prototypes are going to use powerful ML/AI algorithms.<br>
            <br>
            While prototyping, we are also cover some high level theory, so that you have a foundational understanding of key ML algorithms, how they work and what type of tasks they are best suited for.

You need an analysis to support your decision making process. You make decisions every day! You cannot afford waiting for weeks. <br>

            Discovery is about getting an intimate understanding of your customers’ context and how your product fits in that. Once you have that context you gain the power to interpret it and brainstorm solutions.<br>
            <br> 
            Discovery is not something you should ask your manager for permision to do. Yet this is the case in many organisations.<br>
            <br>
            This workshop has two goals: gain a very strong hands-on experience in doing stellar discovery work. Yup, we are going to do actual discovery work together!<br>
            <br>
            2) show you at least three ways you can do discovery without having to go through a heavy approval process<br>
