            Every product person should be able to put together a quick proof of concept 
            independently from their tech team. <br>
            <br>
            During the workshop you are going to build a few prototypes using different ML/AI tools. Part of your prototypes are going to use powerful ML/AI algorithms.<br>
            <br>
            While prototyping, we are also cover some high level theory, so that you have a foundational understanding of key ML algorithms, how they work and what type of tasks they are best suited for.

            <p class="title-description">It takes weeks before you get initial results from a data analysis that you have requested only to find out that it is not exactly what you needed. It needs to be reworked but it is going to take a few more weeks. Too bad, as the analyst team has other priorities. Sounds familiar? Skip the line! You need an analysis to support your decision making process. You make decisions every day! You cannot afford waiting for weeks. <br>
            <br>In this workshop we are going to perform hands-on data analysis that any product manager can do at work. Enough waiting. Let’s get hands on. <br>
            <br>
            During the workshop we are also going to practice asking the right questions from data, so that..v. <br>

            Discovery is about getting an intimate understanding of your customers’ context and how your product fits in that. Once you have that context you gain the power to interpret it and brainstorm solutions.<br>
            <br> 
            Discovery is not something you should ask your manager for permision to do. Yet this is the case in many organisations.<br>
            <br>
            This workshop has two goals: gain a very strong hands-on experience in doing stellar discovery work. Yup, we are going to do actual discovery work together!<br>
            <br>
            2) show you at least three ways you can do discovery without having to go through a heavy approval process<br>
